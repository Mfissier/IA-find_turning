In June, NASA announced that the space observatory had identified more than 700 planet candidates, including five solar systems that had more than one transiting planet.

The orbiter had been scheduled to take off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop its 747 carrier plane on Monday morning. NASA planed to take the craft on a three-day cross-country tour before delivering it to Los Angeles, where it will be put on display at the California Science Center. But storms over the Gulf Coast states forced the agency to postpone Monday's takeoff by a day, and a poor forecast for Tuesday triggered another delay until Wednesday, NASA says. Endeavour was the baby of the shuttle fleet, built as a replacement for the ill-fated Challenger. It made 25 flights into space between 1992 and 2011. A short history of Endeavour .",

Federico Lombardi said Wednesday. Benedict, 85, shocked the world last week when he announced his intention to stand down effective February 28, citing the frailty of old age. Existing rules say the Roman Catholic Church's cardinals should start voting on a replacement from 15 to 20 days after the papal throne becomes vacant. With Benedict's resignation due to start February 28, the cardinals' conclave ordinarily would start no sooner than March 15. But Lombardi has said that because Benedict was leaving the papacy through resignation rather than death, the Vatican would explore the possibility of selecting a new pope sooner than normally prescribed.",

The attack in the southwestern Pakistan city of Quetta left at least 180 people wounded. The explosives were packed into a parked water tanker and were remotely detonated, said Mir Zubair Mehmood, a senior police official in Quetta. The South Asian nation, overwhelmingly Sunni, has been beset by sectarian strife and attacks for years. Mehmood said the attack targeted a Shiite Hazara community. Ethnic Hazaras live mostly in Afghanistan, and there are also Hazara enclaves in Afghanistan and Iran. President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf strongly condemned the bombing and vowed to go after the militants. Earlier this year, a wave of attacks in Quetta left 87 people dead in the Shiite community.",

Italian media reported the boat had 600 people onboard. Italy has seen a series of tragedies as migrants in crowded boats cross from North Africa to Europe. In October, Lampedusa made international headlines when more than 300 African migrants died when their ship sank off its shores. As the closest Italian island to Africa, Lampedusa is a frequent destination for refugees seeking to enter European Union countries. Many of the migrants are from African nations while others have fled war-torn Syria. Hundreds more have been rescued from often unseaworthy vessels and taken to the tiny Mediterranean island's overcrowded detention center.",
